Hi! I'm a Fulltack Developer based in REACT/NODE JS from Argentina!
I'm also a lawyer graduated in 2016 in UBA (Universidad de Buenos Aires). I'm always trying to learn and challenge me with new studies and projects.
I started learning web development by myself in the beggining of 2020, then i decided to study in UTN and Coderhouse (both in Argentina). Now in Tzuzul Code, a bootcamp from Mexico. I've been working and participating in projects since 2021, and now im working in Azor Studio a freelance developer and design studio.
The projects I've developed and participated developing are based in html, css, sass, bootstrap, js, react, vue, nodejs, express, mongodb, mysql, firebase, php and wordpress. You can see some of my projects here in my githubs repos, and also next i leave some of wordpress/php works and participations:
